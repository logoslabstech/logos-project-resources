# Logos Project Resource Repository
**This repository serves as an essential resource for the Logos project, containing non-code materials such as research, concepts, RFCs and technical specifications.**

**The Logos Project is an initiative dedicated to transforming the provision and management of physical infrastructure for Web3. It moves beyond centralized data centers and cloud services of Web2, aiming to establish a trustless, resilient, and sustainable foundation for a truly decentralized Internet.**

## Repository structure
> [!NOTE]  
> Since the project is in the early stages, the structure of the project may change or may be extended.

- **Additional resources** (/additional-resources):  
This section contains supplementary materials that support the understanding, implementation, or expansion of the Logos Project. These resources include external references and auxiliary documentation.

- **Archive** (/archive):  
This section hosts outdated or superseded documents, such as older concept papers and drafts. These are preserved for historical reference and to provide context on the evolution of the Logos Network.

- **Concepts** (/concepts):  
his section includes foundational documents outlining the core ideas, principles, and initial designs related to the Logos Project. 
These materials provide insight into the conceptual framework that guides the development and implementation of the project.

- **Research** (/research):  
This section contains individual research papers developed by LogosLabs or in collaboration with other entities.
These papers explore topics relevant to the development and provision of the Logos Network.
All research materials are also available in [wiki-format](https://docs.logoslabs.io/research/research-overview) within the Logos documentation.

- **RFCs** (/rfcs):  
Here, you will find Requests for Comments (RFCs) that outline proposals, discussions, and decisions regarding the technical design and development of the Logos Network. RFCs serve as a structured process for community feedback and collaboration.

- **Specifications** (/specifications):  
This section contains the official technical specifications for the Logos Network. These documents provide precise details on protocols, standards, and implementations required to build and maintain the network.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Original Concept Paper for the Logos Network (Outdated)**  
> The original concepts of the Logos Network are no longer up to date, as certain parts have been revised and are now treated differently.  
> While **the vision and the fundamental concept remain unchanged**, the technical implementation has evolved slightly. To avoid confusion, the document has been archived.
>  
> A new concept paper will not be released, as the forthcoming technical specification paper, currently in development, will address its purpose.
